# QML-Lecture

## Hello World Example

The example `hello-world` is a simple pure QML application that demonstrates how to:
1. create a window and visual contents
2. build interaction between components
3. add transition effects

## NeumorphicPanel Example

The `neumorphic-panel` example showcases creating shadow effects in QML.
It is adopted from an official Qt example [3].
Note, the feature `RectangularShadow` is introduced in Qt 6.9, so ensure you have the correct version of Qt to build this example.
